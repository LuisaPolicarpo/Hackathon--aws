# Hackathon--AWS

## Content:
Welcome to our 3 day hackathon (datathon) sponsored by Amazon Web Services as part of our Data Analysis bootcamp at Wild Code School! 
The goal of this project was to perform exhaustive EDA on the housing market for the Ile-de-France (France) region and design leverage Machine Learning technology to predict house prices. 

## Project Overview

### Our scope:
- We worked from the perspective of a team of consultants that received a mandate from a real estate agency willing to leverage data to gain competitive advantage. With that in mind, our solution is twofold:
    - District recommendation engine based on users actual district (neighborhood). 
    - Price prediction system for the recommended districts and user inputs such as desired sqm and number of rooms. 
 
 This solution is presented in the form of an online application.

### Data:
- The data was gathered from the french government (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/5c4ae55a634f4117716d5656) and considers all transactions from 2019 to 2022. 

### Technology:
- EDA: Pandas library. 
- Machine Learning: NearestNeighboors algorithm for the district recommendation engine and LinearRegression for the price prediction. 
- Application - user interface: Streamlit.
